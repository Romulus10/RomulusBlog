title: Akvanta Help

Every time the Akvanta game itself is updated, the help pages need to be modified to reflect the changes. As the game progresses, it becomes increasingly easy to overlook things while updating the help pages and the wiki. This is a solo-developed project- if you're reading through the help or the wiki and notice something that doesn't seem quite right, or notice a bug in the game, drop a comment on one of my posts! If you're a GitHub user, feel free to file an issue or a pull request.
