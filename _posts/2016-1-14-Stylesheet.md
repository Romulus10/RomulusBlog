The SASS rendering built into Jekyll now is kind of tricky. I'd never used it before. I expected most color names to work out of the box, like CSS colors. However if I'm seeing this right, the $ before the color's name acts the same was as it does in PHP- as a signal that a variables being referred to. Because I didn't have the names I was using assigned to, the build failed several times before I just gave up and started using conventional hex values for the colors.
