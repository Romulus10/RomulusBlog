So last night at about 11:00, a friend and I had the brilliant idea that we wanted to write our own derivative of the esoteric programming language brainf\*\*k, and we wanted to implement the interpreter in Rust. Our tired minds devised the masterful scheme that we just had to make every command an emoji. By the end of our 24-hour programming extravaganza, we have a fully working brainf\*\*k dialect where every command is an emoji. We have the website hosted at [emotifuck.rs](http://emotifuck.rs).
