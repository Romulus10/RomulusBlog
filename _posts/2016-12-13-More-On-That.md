As you might expect, debugging anything when it doesn't even know how to use its own hardware is a challenge. It's been a couple of weeks since any work was done on the OS. A number of other projects kind of took over and writing an operating system wasn't much of a priority. The most progress we've made is getting the Pi's status light to blink a Morse code SOS. That doesn't sound like anything at all frankly but when it's the first time you've even begun to try and write ARM assembler code, it's exhilarating when that stupid light finally blinks. The code is not yet hosted on Github for the simple reason that we don't have enough of a codebase to warrant making it any kind of public. Hopefully in the coming weeks we'll have more than just a blinking light.
