Student of computing science, Python enthusiast. Very real interest in security and algorithmic efficiency. 

I try to only blog about an issue, a project, or a topic that I've personally experienced. All of my writing is driven by my own investigations, so that I can help to drive discussion of issues. 

# Projects
## [Akvanta](http://github.com/Romulus10/Akvanta)
## [Encrypted Messenger in Java](http://github.com/Romulus10/messenger)
## [CheckBook](http://github.com/Romulus10/CheckBook)
And more than willing to contribute to other projects in any way I can.
